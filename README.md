This repository contains two different approaches to address the SemEval 2012 Task 6 (Semantic Textual Similarity) which consists in, given two pair of sentences, provide a similarity value between them. This task is also known as paraphrases detection. A paraphrase between two sentences or texts is when both have the same meaning using different words. 

In the repository you can find two jupyter notebooks (one for each approach) containing the code for the different models used and the results obtained. You will also find the datasets required for this task, other external resources used (such as InferSent and FastText) and a PDF file with an explanation of the work done, the approaches tried and the results obtained.

## Results
The best result obtained is (pearson correlation between the gold-standard similarity values and the ones from our system): **82.46%**.
This result overpasses the result obtained by the winner of the SemEval 2012 competition.
